Crowmap (Fabric)
================

Makes maps update when you hold them anywhere in your inventory, not just your hand. Now for ~~1.16~~ ~~1.17~~ ~~1.17.1~~ ~~1.18.0~~ at least one version of minecraft!

Pretty cool!

### LICENSE stuff

Versions for 1.16 and above are "LGPL 3.0 or later" just been unifying all my mods under that lately.

Older versions are MPL.
