Crowmap
=======

Crowmap makes vanilla maps update even when you're not holding them.

Made for /u/Crowfooted, here's the [original reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/9b8a5j/making_best_use_of_vanilla_maps/).

It registry replaces the map item, so the usual registry-replacement warning applies: it's not gonna work with anything else that registry replaces maps.

It also adds a little tooltip to maps that just informs you that the mod is present, in case it ever gets into a modpack or something; if you don't want it, you can disable it with the configuration file.
